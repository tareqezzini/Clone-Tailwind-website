# Clone-Tailwind-website
This repository contains a website clone built using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that helps in rapidly building modern and responsive web interfaces. The project is a replica of a popular website, created to showcase my skills in front-end web development and proficiency in utilizing Tailwind CSS.
